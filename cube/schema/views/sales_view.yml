# In Cube, views are used to expose slices of your data graph and act as data marts.
# You can control which measures and dimensions are exposed to BIs or data apps, 
# as well as the direction of joins between the exposed cubes.
# You can learn more about views in documentation here - https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/view
